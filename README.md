# Vision-To_Speech-AI-Project-
Final Project Assessment for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Course that uses a pre-trained model, taking a video input and producing a speech out put in a specified language


### Overview
This project leverages advanced machine learning models to convert video input into descriptive speech output. By using a pre-trained BLIP model, we generate captions for each frame of a video, filter out similar descriptions, and then convert the unique descriptions into speech. The application can be hosted either locally or on the cloud.
